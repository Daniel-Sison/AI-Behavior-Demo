# AI Behavior Demo


Please note that this is repository is just a demo mainly to showcase my style of programming.



In order to use the scripts, you must place the appropriate scripts under the appropriate places according to the folder's name.

For example, the behavior script under "R15_Model" folder should be placed in an R15 Model (that contains a Humanoid and HumanoidRootPart) in game.
