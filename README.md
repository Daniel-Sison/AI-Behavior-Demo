# AI Behavior Demo


Please note that this is repository is just a demo mainly to showcase my style of programming.



Installation Instructions:

  In order to use the scripts, you must place the appropriate scripts under the appropriate places according to the folder's name.

  1. The behavior script under "R15_Model" folder should be placed in an R15 Model 
     (that contains a Humanoid and HumanoidRootPart) in game.
     
  2. The folders under "ReplicatedStorage" should be placed under "ReplicatedStorage".



The example game has been uploaded as well
with all of the folders and scripts in the right places.


It is called "AI_Example.rbxl".
